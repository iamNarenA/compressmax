## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── GameCanvas.tsx   # Main game rendering
│   └── GameHUD.tsx      # UI overlay
├── screens/             # App screens
│   ├── MenuScreen.tsx   # Main menu

    └── gameLogic.ts     # Game mechanics
```

### Performance Optimization
- 60 FPS game loop using `setInterval`
- Efficient collision detection algorithms
- Minimal re-renders with `useRef` for game state
- Optimized component structure and prop passing

### Testing
```bash
# Run on physical devices for performance testing
# Test different screen sizes and orientations
# Verify haptic feedback and sound
# Test pause/resume and app backgrounding
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: Check `eas.json` configuration
- **Performance issues**: Reduce game object count or optimize rendering
- **Touch responsiveness**: Verify gesture handler setup
- **Store rejection**: Ensure compliance with platform guidelines

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Clear Metro cache
npx expo start --clear

# Check build status
eas build:list

# View detailed logs
npx expo start --dev-client
```
